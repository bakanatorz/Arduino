Eric Bakan's Arduino Library

This is a repository where I can keep all the sketches I write for my Arduino.

So far I've only written basic stuff because I lack any other components, but I am in the process of building an Arduino-based Monome clone and other sound-related projects.

The Makefile is a modified version of the file found at the following location: https://linvinus.ru/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=robot:arduino_makefile
